    <h2>Jeff Bezos Once Said... </h2>

    <li>"Your brand is what people say about you when you're not in the room."</li>
    <li>"I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not trying."</li>
   <li> "The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you. It just works."</li>
    <li>"A brand for a company is like a reputation for a person. You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well."</li>
    <li>"What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world changes around you and when it changes against you - what used to be a tailwind is now a headwind - you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn't a strategy."
    <li>"I believe you have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate."</li>
   <li> "We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better."</li>
    <li>"If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful."</li>
    <li>"We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient."</li>
    <li>"I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out."</li>
    <li>"If you don't understand the details of your business, you are going to fail."</li>
    <li>"If you can't tolerate critics, don't do anything new or interesting."</li>
    <li>"The common question that gets asked in business is, 'why?' That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, 'why not?'"</li>
    <li>"We are willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time."</li>
    <li>"I believe in the power of wandering. All of my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart, intuition, guts... not analysis."</li>
    <li>"You have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate."</li>
