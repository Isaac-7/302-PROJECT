<h3>What Elon suggests...</h3>


<li> Be passionate about your work</li>
Musk says the key to success is to be passionate about what you're doing. "People should pursue what they're passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else."
<br><br><br>
<li>Take risks</li>
Musk says you need to be willing to take risks if you want to be successful and grow your bank account. In a 2012 interview, Musk said, "Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering" because "there's a tremendous bias against taking risks." Musk believes the biggest risk is not taking any risk, especially in a world that's changing quickly. The only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
<br><br><br>
<li>Be prepared to work hard</li>
Musk is known for his work ethic. "Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up." Musk believes that in order to succeed, people will need to "work like hell." Working harder than others will improve your odds of success. "If other people are putting in 40 hour workweeks and you're putting in 100 hour workweeks, then even if you're doing the same thing, you know that you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve." You have to be prepared to work hard and sacrifice a lot of things in order to make your business successful.
<br><br><br>
<li>Be persistent</li>
Success didn't come easy for Musk. He had his fair share of failures, but he persisted and didn't give up. Musk was ousted from two companies he co-founded, Zip2 and PayPal. Both Tesla and SpaceX were on the brink of bankruptcy as a result of the 2008 recession, and many thought Musk would fail again. Musk learned from his earlier mistakes, and anyone can look at his experiences to find inspiration to reach their own financial milestones.
<br><br><br>
<li>Continue to invest in yourself</li>
Musk's single best piece of advice? "Constantly think about how you could be doing things better, and questioning yourself." By the age of 8, Musk was reading 10 hours a day. He ran out of books to read at the library, so he decided to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica. From an early age, Musk constantly focused on learning and investing in himself. He taught himself to program, and by age 12, he wrote and sold a video game for $500. He then double-majored in physics and economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Musk continually invested in himself and his dreams and now he is the wealthiest man in the world.

<h3>What Bernard suggests...</h3>

<li>There is no reason to be obsessed with money</li>
Bernard Arnault is one of those businessmen who does not seek for a focused approach to money but pays attention to the potential that the implemented strategies can bring. He always says that “money is just a consequence. I usually tell my team not to worry too much about profit. If you do your job well, profit will come”. This is a lesson that many other billionaires tend to follow. Also, the above information is evidenced by the simple fact that Bernard Arnault did not become one of the richest men in the world until just a few years ago. It took time for his bet to pay off. Lastly, there was not exactly a focus on a huge win from the start.
<br><br><br>
<li>Do not think of yourself</li>
The difference between Bernard Arnault and other billionaires like Elon Musk or Bill Gates is that all he cares about is promoting his brands, never himself. Some businessmen like the two mentioned above have created a personal image alongside with their business accomplishments to ensure that they will remain on the public scene. On the other hand, the French businessman has never been the face of his company, but always focuses on the products, making them stay in our minds longer. He is a man with a more discreet vision. Arnault, because of his business strategy knows that the focus should be on the designers and the people in charge of the products he has undertaken. “What entertains me is trying to turn creativity into business reality around the world. To do this, you need to stay in touch with pioneers and designers, but also make their ideas more specific and sustainable” he says.
<br><br><br>
<li>Have confidence in your vision</li>
“I remember people telling me that it didn't make sense to put so many brands together, but in the end it was a success. It was a recognized success and for the last 10 years every competitor has been trying to follow us. I think they are not successful, but they are trying” comments Arnault. He started buying brands in the 1980s, but only in the last decade has become one of the most important billionaires in the world. Like other successful men, he refused to listen to criticism and followed his own vision in the end, displaying an excellent strategy. “In business, we will always find these different voices, and although there will certainly be good advice, if you think an idea will succeed, you may need to keep going until the end” he states.
<br><br><br>
<li>Do not lose contact with your company</li>
“One of the worst leadership mistakes is to forget the company when we are at the top and “stick” with easy goals. You really have to look at every corner and every part of the machine to see if it works properly or if there is room for improvement. I often tell my team that we should act like we're part of a small business.

<h3>What Jeff suggests...</h3>

<li>Be stubborn but flexible.</li>
It might seem like mutually exclusive traits, but it is possible to be both stubborn and flexible. As a matter of fact, being stubborn in the pursuit of your goals (but flexible in how you go about it) has helped Bezos to succeed. He explained in a Fast Company article that “If you're not stubborn, you'll give up on experiments too soon. And if you're not flexible, you'll pound your head against the wall, and you won’t see a different solution to a problem you’re trying to solve.”
<br><br><br>
<li>Be stubborn but flexible.</li>
In the business world, instinct is more important that data sets, according to Bezos.

“If you can make a decision with analysis, you should do so. But it turns out in life that your most important decisions are always made with instinct and intuition,” he said.
<br><br><br>
<li>Start small</li>
Bezos favours a personal touch over a massive corporate apparatus, especially in a company's early stages. He noted that Amazon had just five employees when it opened its doors.

“It's hard to remember for you guys, but for me it's like yesterday I was driving the packages to the post office myself, and hoping one day we could afford a forklift,” Bezos said.
<br><br><br>
<li>Don't rush growth and think long-term.</li>
A lot of people want success, and they want it now. However, making a mark in an industry or transforming your startup into a profitable one in under a year is next to impossible. “Think long term and do not sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.”– is one of the main Amazon business principles, according to Bezos.
<br><br><br>
<li>Learn from your competitors.</li>
It's a good idea to keep a close eye on your competitors. Bezos admitted that Amazon watches its rivals in order to “learn from them, see the things that they were doing for customers and copy those things as much as we can.” After all, if something isn't broke, why fix it? It's better to build on something that's already proven to work and put your own twist to it.

<h3>What Larry suggest...</h3>
<li>Do the impossible</li>
“When I was here at Michigan, I had actually been taught how to make dreams real!

I know it sounds funny, but that is what I learned in a summer camp converted into a training program called Leadershape.”

“Their slogan is to have a “healthy disregard for the impossible”.

That program encouraged me to pursue a crazy idea at the time:

I wanted to build a personal rapid transit system on campus to replace the buses. It was a futuristic way of solving our transportation problem.”

“I still think a lot about transportation  you never lose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby.

Many things that people labor hard to do now, like cooking, cleaning, and driving will require much less human time in the future.

That is, if we “have a healthy disregard for the impossible” and actually build new solutions.”

“I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams.

I know that sounds completely nuts. But, since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. There are so few people this crazy.”
Work on something uncomfortably exciting!
<br><br><br>

<li>Work on something uncomfortably exciting!</li>
“The best people want to work the big challenges. That is what happened with Google.

Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

How can that not get you excited?

But we almost didn't start Google because my co-founder Sergey and I were too worried about dropping out of our Ph.D. program.”

“You are probably on the right track if you feel like a sidewalk worm during a rainstorm!

That is about how we felt after we maxed out three credit cards buying hard disks off the back of a truck.

That was the first hardware for Google. Parents and friends.. more credit cards always help. ”

“What is the one sentence summary of how you change the world?

Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting!.”

Work on something uncomfortably exciting!
<br><br><br>

<li>Aim to be more lazy</li>
“As a Ph.D. student, I actually had three projects I wanted to work on. Thank goodness my adviser said, “why do'’t you work on the web for a while”.

Technology and especially the internet can really help you be lazy. Lazy? ”

“What I mean is a group of three people can write software that millions can use and enjoy.

Can three people answer the phone a million times a day?

Find the leverage in the world, so you can be more lazy!”

<h3>What Bill Suggests</h3>
<li>You Need A Coach.</li>
In life, you become the person you admire. So, If you don't admire anybody you become a nobody. You need someone to inspire and challenge you, also, someone to help you believe in yourself.

Get a mentor and follow the steps your mentor followed to become successful, you also will be successful too
<br><br><br>

<li>Spend Time Educating Yourself</li>
If you want to be successful you have to learn every day. Successful people don't stop learning. They know they can lose if they don't keep on learning.

Spend time reading books because you will find a lot of secrets to success in books. The books you read determine the future you have.
<br><br><br>
<li>Two are better than one (Partnership).</li>
Bill Gate advice about success has always based on partnerships from the very beginning.

You grow and succeed in life faster if you learn how to work with other people.

<br><br><br>
<li>To Win Big, You Have To Take Big Risks</li>
The best time in your life to bear life is when you are young because you have nothing to lose.

Don't think life is easy. Don't just talk about your dreams and goals, Don't Make Excuses, take action. Start with whatever you have wherever you are.

The world is full of uncertainties. Life has no rules and you have to sacrifice certain things to get to your destination.

People will step on and reject you but at the end of the day, if you are able to muster the courage to keep on going, nothing will stand in your way.
